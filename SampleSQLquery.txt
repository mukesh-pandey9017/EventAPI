along with eventdetails. The query should optimize for large datasets and
return the top 3 events by tickets sold.

Event.object.all().aggregate('total_ticket_sold'=Sum('tickets_sold'))

2)query to fetch the total tickets sold for all events along with eventdetails
Event.objects.all().order_by("-tickets_sold")

3)query for top 3 events by tickets sold
Event.objects.all().order_by("-tickets_sold")[:3]
